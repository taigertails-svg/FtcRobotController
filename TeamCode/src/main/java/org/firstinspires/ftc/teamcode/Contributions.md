## Contribution rules:

1. No vibe coding. (no AI)
2. Variables should preferably not be shortened. (private Servo SL would be wrong.)
3. All variables should be pascal case. (for example: int HelloWorld)
4. If you added a variable and you're not planning on changing it then add the final keyword before it.
5. All constants should be screaming snake case. (for example: final int HELLO_WORLD)
6. All code should compile without any errors.
7. Code should preferably not have any warnings. (although there are some exceptions.)
8. Comments should have proper grammar.
9. If you're using an if statement to only do a one line statement then use a shorthand if.
10. When adding a new method to a class make sure to add tests to it.
11. Don't add unnecessary space in the code unless you're sure that it's going to become more readable.
12. Make all of the variables you're gonna use in your method at the start of it.
13. Don't use magic numbers, instead add it to constants and use the constant instead. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming))
14. All variables should have clear names.
15. DO NOT touch the "FtcRobotController" folder.
16. If you see that someone made a mistake, fix it.
17. Do not make the variables names too long. (preferably less than 4 words for normal variables and less than 6 words for constants)
18. All methods should have a comment before their declaration explaining what they do.
19. All classes should have a comment before their declaration explaining what they do.
20. When copying code from another project make sure to credit the original creator.
21. When you have more than 3 variable declarations in a row, separate them into different sections using new lines for better readability.
22. If you are planning on changing something in the future in the code, add a comment before with TODO: at the start of it. (and then the explanation of the future change of course)
23. When pushing a change to github make sure you have the latest version of the repository pulled. 
24. When pushing a change to github have a clear name to the change you made in less than 10 words. (you can also add a description but that's entirely optional)
