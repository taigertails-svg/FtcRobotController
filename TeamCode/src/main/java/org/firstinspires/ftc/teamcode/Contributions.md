## Contribution rules:

a. No vibe coding. (no AI)
b. Variables should preferably not be shortened. (private Servo SL would be wrong.)
c. All variables should be pascal case. (for example: int HelloWorld)
d. All constants should be screaming snake case. (for example: final int HELLO_WORLD)
e. All code should compile without any errors.
f. Code should preferably not have any warnings. (although there are some exceptions.)
g. Comments should have proper grammar.
